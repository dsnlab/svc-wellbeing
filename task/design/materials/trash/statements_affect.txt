find homework hard
worry about grades
worry about high school
count calories
dislike my body
can get moody
hide my feelings
feel lonely
ignore my parents
can't keep secrets  
can't ignore gossip 
get mad at friends
act without thinking
think smoking is gross
wish I was in love
worry about kissing
dream about my wedding 
feel shy in groups
want to be popular
can't wait to be older
copy homework
weigh myself
want to be alone
get embarrassed
tease my sibling
make friends easily
wish I had more friends
tell little lies
like breaking rules
worry about drugs
like flirting
judge people
get picked on
can be mean
don't like my life
pretend to like people
think I'm weird
can be awkward
get self-conscious
think I'm too quiet
think I look bomb
hate going to school
