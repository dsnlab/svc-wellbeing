like wearing makeup
wear leggings
like to doodle
carry chapstick
like sleepovers
sing in the shower
can be creative
like to wear hats
drink milk
like reality TV
read magazines
can be messy
wear sunglasses
like eating out
don't brush my teeth
go barefoot
take bubble baths
listen to music
try new foods
braid my hair
play board games
like leftovers
shower before bed
try to recycle
like cold pizza
use lotion
wear PJs all day
wear bright colors
forget people's names
stay up late
burn my toast
go to the movies
wear flip flops
like wearing costumes
sleep in late
paint my nails
don't make my bed
like watching sports
forget to turn off lights
decorate my room
like burning candles
go to the pool
